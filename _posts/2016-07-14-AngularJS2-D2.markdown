title: AngularJS2, The Second Day

Angular JS2 is quite confusing, but I think I can make it!.

## Today's Harvest!

First of all, I rewrite a small Angular JS2 project to check my memory and key information.
And then I start a new project -- establish a web app which could receive contact information by service
then show the details by clicking the name of people in the contact list. It does consume much time to do 
this, because the service section is quite ambiguous to me and need time to digest.
Anyway, this small app finally worked! And I tried to insert a vedio link in it to display media streams using
video instruction. To test whether the video works properly or not, I searched for a mp4 resource, and one of
a guy provided me a source link and the video section did worked! However, the content of the video was quite...
por...um. Then I tried to copy media link from a media website and I succeed! I could play Game of Thrones in my 
own website! But I'm not sure if there is any legal issue...

Now I'm trying to upload my first image file to my blog!
Let's see my Snorlax!
