Lynda.com--a great tutorial website that enhance your horizon.

## Today's Harvest!

Lynda.com is a great video education website which provides various courses about being a software/web developer.
I want to highly recommend this site to those who want to learn coding. Especially, if you are a Unimelb student,
you could access these resources free, by logging in with your Unimelb student account.
I slowed down the pace of learing AngularJS2 these days, because I thought it would be better to enrich background
knowledge so that I could understand what angular is doing.
Today, I updated my "contact" project with a function that allows user to create a new contact based on the contact
which has already been selected. It requires a good understand of routing and passing data through routes and fetch 
them into your function. Now it is just a basic version without any guard system. I will continue adding guarding 
functions into the project in these days.
After that, I will continue studying about AngularJS2 Pipe and Form.
