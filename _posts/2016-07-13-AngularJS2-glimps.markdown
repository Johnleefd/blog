After building a blog webpage using jekyll, I begin to learn the webdesign method --Angular JS.

## Today's Harvest!

Angular JS provide a concept of building a website with Component,Service,Directive and so on.
They are combined to build up an app, however, some sources are able to apply for another application. 
It means AngularJS has a great potential of extansion without duplicated coding works!

Today, I finished installing and running a test by watching Youtube streams. 
I have tried the basic flow of building a webpage , starts form building components ,directives, and services to 
meet the goal in various ways.

There are so many new things to learn about Angular JS2, wish I will enjoy it!
